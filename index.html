        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Sean Dillon and I would be a great asset to any work team. I'm a second year college student looking for part-time work and real world experience. I'm a high academic achiever that understands the importance of quality and commitment. As a student athlete I know the caliber of teamwork for success. I have been a musician since a young age which has also taught me the value of working with people as well as long term discipline. I would consider myself to be independent and great at problem solving. My attitude towards my work is outgoing and energetic. I have a good amount of work and volunteer experience so I am quite familiar with many work environments. I hope to further my career in education and eventually make big impacts in education policy. 
<br><br>

        I worked at a high quality gelato section of Eataly in the Valley Fair Mall as a server. My responsibilities were serving customers, ringing them up as cashier, and cleaning. I worked long shifts most days of the week and we often had busy days of constant service until closing. This experience took a lot of effort and commitment because for a time during my employment I was one of only 5 workers not including the owner.
As an associate I oversaw different tasks everyday. Most often I was working on the sales floor helping consumers find items and generally boosting sales. In addition to this I worked in the back doing stock, managed the fitting rooms, and worked on the registers. I had a range of responsibilities from making sales to cleaning the store and closing since I always worked late shifts. This job taught me a lot about customer service and independence over the 10 months I worked there.
<br><br>

        As an after school tutor for elementary level students, my main focus was homework help. Some of my many responsibilities were teaching basic math and English skills, managing a classroom, providing a friendly and approachable presence, and helping students learn fundamental social skills. The biggest challenge I overcame was working with troubled students who didn't listen to authority. However, in the few months I volunteered at this school I'm proud to say I created an exceptionally strong bond with most, if not all of my students.
My past experiences working have taught me a lot about what I want from my jobs. I think being regularly engaged in work is important to foster a sense of responsibility and commitment. I would be more than happy to help any coworkers in need because teaching is one of my passions. Currently I am looking for any experience that I can gain something from in my path to my career. Thank you for considering me and I look forward to hearing from you!
